## Overview

This is the screenshot from shiny app
![img](./images/app-screenshoot.png)

This project aim to visualize CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem) with meta heuristic algorithm. There are two algorithm on the app currently: Genetic algorithm and Simulated annealing.

The shiny app is still underdevelopment

## Future work

- Allow user to provide data
- Add user feed back on running progress (NEED HELP)
- Implement more algorithm: (Tabu search, sweep,...)

## Run app on your machine

If you are interested in this project and want to run it on your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vohai611/cvrp-genetic
cd cvrp-genetic/cvrp-app
Rscript -e "shiny::runApp()"

```
**NOTE:** This app require several package to be installed beforehand.
