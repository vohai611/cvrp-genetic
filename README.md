## Overview

This is the screenshot from shiny app
![img](./images/app-screenshoot.png)

This project aim to visualize CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem)
with meta heuristic algorithm. There are two algorithm on the app
currently: Genetic algorithm and Simulated annealing.

The shiny app is still underdevelopment

## Future work

-   [x] Allow user to provide data
-   [ ] Add user feed back on running progress (NEED HELP)
-   [ ] Implement more algorithm: (Tabu search, sweep,â€¦)

## Run app on your machine

If you are interested in this project and want to run it on your machine

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/vohai611/cvrp-genetic
cd cvrp-genetic/cvrp-app
Rscript -e "shiny::runApp()"
```

or you can build Docker image with Dockerfile

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/vohai611/cvrp-genetic
cd cvrp-genetic/cvrp-app
docker build -t cvrp-app ./ 
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 cvrp-app
```

**NOTE:** This app require several package to be installed beforehand.
They are listed in `require-packages.R`
